Over the course of my career, I have been part of several science and engineering teams. I have seen great leaders and
terrible leaders, as well as junior team members who grew quickly and those who got stuck. People who led by example and
inspired others, and people who drove others up the wall and caused untold suffering.

The defining factor separating the good from the bad in all of the above experiences was emotional awareness and
empathetic communication.

Engineering education and professional training does not prepare new graduates for the intense teamwork required in
professional settings.  Except in some internship opportunities, most new graduates have very episodic exposure to
working in teams. While ambitious engineers usually have a good idea of the technical achievements their next growth
phase might entail (or their next promotion might require), they often have no idea or at least no clear incentive to
improve their communication skills - critical for organizing their team, motivating and mentoring their colleagues,
communicating product requirements to product management and executive stakeholders, and managing customer relationships
(yes, engineers should play a role in that).

Effective communication is the limiting factor in most engineers' professional growth.

Some scientists - and engineers with science training - have an advantage, as science training emphasizes written
communication as well as teaching skills through TA work in graduate school. Even that advantage turns out to be
relatively small, because most organizations don't actually verbalize the success factors that enable effective
communication in their engineering teams.

Google's "people ops" ("HR department that hopefully doesn't suck") put together a [nice
website](https://rework.withgoogle.com/blog/five-keys-to-a-successful-google-team/) outlining some of these key success
factors, but even that only just begins to summarize the key insights that engineers realize over time.

The key breakthrough in my understanding of the importance of practicing emotional awareness and empathetic
communication came from my work with an engineering executive who stepped in to manage a bunch of teams as they
struggled to find structure and clarity. After this woman joined the team, she did not focus on holding people
to specific engineering objectives or product outcomes. Instead she advocated (but did not force) an overall
project management process, and spent almost all of her time building relationships with team members without
regard to their level in the reporting chain. Her calendar was always open for 1:1s, and after establishing initial
rapport her next step was always to give the person a copy of the book,
[How to Talk So Kids Will Listen & Listen So Kids Will Talk](https://www.amazon.com/How-Talk-Kids-Will-Listen-ebook/dp/B005GG0MXI).

The simple and profound truth is that truly empathising with each person on your team is a necessary and often
sufficient condition for upleveling your communication skills to the point where they are no longer a limiting
factor in your professional growth. The content of the book is just as applicable to adults as it is to children.
In worklace teams, we are trained to suppress the negative emotions that come from neglecting our need for
empathy - with major negative consequences. If even marginally emotionally abusive behavior is normalized, the team
suffers permanent damage and can no longer function properly. Conversely, empathetic, emotionally aware, and
comprehensive communication empowers the team to make incremental improvements which translate to greatly
increased performance over time.

The last key pattern that I have observed in successful engineering teams is a productive interaction between the
customer champion, the internal product stakeholder, and the technical roadmap planner. Different teams have different
names for these roles, but they are commonly referred to as a UX researcher, a product manager, and a technical product
manager or scrum master. Each competency in this trio is necessary for the team to succeed, and effective, high
bandwidth, low ego communication between the three is a key determinant of team productivity and happiness - of all
the success factors listed on the Google website above. The customer champion must effectively and passionately
represent the customer's needs - in fact, they need to be backed up by each team member as well (this is the Amazon
leadership principle of "customer obsession"). The product manager must determine product strategy, plan large long-term
efforts, and steer the team through complex product improvements. The TPM or scrum master must have deep technical
knowledge of the product's infrastructure and the ability to plan tactical efforts to execute the team's strategy. The
TPM must also be an effective advocate for the team's ability to manage technical debt (which works in a way that's
remarkably similar to sovereign debt). In fact, the third thing that the engineering executive I mentioned above did
after impressing the power of empathy and establishing a PM process was to inquire about the team's technical debt level
and what it's doing to manage it over time.

The interaction among the UX-PM-TPM trio can be evaluated to determine the level of stakeholder value alignment. Do
the three parties have a shared understanding of the team's priorities and how they will deliver customer value over
time? If there is ambiguity about the answer, then they can go back to the communication first principles to improve
this mutual understanding.
