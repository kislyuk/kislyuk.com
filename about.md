Hi! I am a software engineer and a bioinformatician. I work at the
[Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/), where I currently spend most of my time doing
infrastructure work on the [IDseq](https://idseq.net/) project. My job is to enable the IDseq team to ensure our product
analyzes pathogen DNA reliably, correctly, and quickly at all times, as well as to collaborate with the scientific and
engineering community at large - for example, by sharing our production analysis methods as code in the
[idseq-workflows](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/idseq-workflows) repo. Recently, IDseq has been used by
[Biohub](https://www.czbiohub.org/) scientists and others to analyze SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) viral DNA and associated
metagenomes.

Prior to CZI, I was involved with a number of biotech startups which gave me the opportunity to become an expert in
the design and implementation of genome analysis systems and cloud platforms. I am particularly known for building
state of the art systems for DNA sequence analysis, machine learning applications in genomics, scalable distributed
systems for genomics, API design, Linux systems, information security, and development operations. Specific applications
that I was involved with include single-molecule DNA sequencing R&D, microbial genome and metagenome annotation and
interpretation, single-cell sequencing, variant calling and interpretation, and phylogenomics. Since 2011, I have
been using Amazon Web Services to build these solutions, and I am now an expert in many AWS technologies. I also admire
the AWS leadership principle of customer obsession and use it to guide decisions in teams and products that I am
involved with.

Before my industry career, I graduated from [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) with a triple major in computer
science, mathematics, and statistics, and from [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/) with a PhD in bioinformatics.
My undergraduate research work was at Lawrence Berkeley Lab with
[Inna Dubchak](https://biosciences.lbl.gov/profiles/inna-dubchak-2/) and
[Mike Brudno](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~brudno/public/). Together with Mike's advisor
[Serafim Batzoglou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serafim_Batzoglou), we created the
[first global multiple genome alignment of multiple large eukaryotic genomes](https://genome.cshlp.org/content/19/4/682.long).
My graduate advisor was [Joshua Weitz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Weitz), and my thesis title was
[Algorithm development for next generation sequencing-based metagenome analysis](https://smartech.gatech.edu/bitstream/handle/1853/42779/kislyuk_andrey_o_201012_phd.pdf).

A few notable state of the art infrastructure projects that I implemented include an
[LXC](https://linuxcontainers.org/)-based cloud PaaS virtualization service which continues to power millions of jobs
and Docker apps on the [DNAnexus Titan](https://www.dnanexus.com/product-overview/titan) platform, an independent
implementation of [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language), OAuth2/OIDC, and their
underlying technologies for single sign-on applications, an AWS IAM-based symbolic RBAC PDP service, and multiple API
designs, CLI tools, and developer productivity tools for a variety of products. On the science side, I have mostly
been involved in integration and tuning of existing genomics and machine learning software written by people smarter
than me, but you can see some of my concrete contributions in my
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=7deTos4AAAAJ&sortby=pubdate) profile.

The technologies I use in my daily work include Terraform, AWS Fargate, S3, EFS, Lambda, Step Functions, IAM,
RDS/Aurora, Python, Rust, OIDC, LXC, Docker, [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/), as well as many genomics tools
including [Kraken2](https://ccb.jhu.edu/software/kraken2/), [miniwdl](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/miniwdl),
[bedtools2](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2), and [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2).

I live in San Francisco. In my spare time I do a lot of the usual suspect activities such as biking, running,
photography, and selecting the proper power tools for home improvement.
