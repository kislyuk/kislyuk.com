Hello! 

We are excited about hosting you in the Bay Area this fall. 

Our wedding is taking place with just two months of planning. And we know it’s short notice for many guests traveling from afar. We appreciate all the effort you’re making for the journey here this fall. 

We chose the date because six years ago, we met in a cold November night in Atlanta. Since then, we’ve lived mostly apart and even on different continents. Now that we are happily settled in the same city, we’d love to have you here to celebrate our union. 

We are both immigrants whose families moved to California in our youth, so we are excited to host you in a place that means a lot to both of us and our parents. 

All the invitations will be handled electronically and we’re sort of skipping some wedding conventions. ;-) 

So please join our families and friends in a night of celebration, yummy food and happiness.  

Love, 
Madison (Ye) & Andrey

Venue 

We will be getting married at the Piedmont Community Hall, located about 10 miles east of San Francisco. 

The address is 711 Highland Ave., Oakland, CA 94611

DRIVE  
https://www.google.com/maps/place/711+Highland+Ave,+Oakland,+CA+94611/@37.823802,-122.229767,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f877b39b7aa0b:0x89eafa7ed36054dd?hl=en

There will be a free parking lot available and plenty of street parking. 

If you choose not to drive, you can opt for public transportation or take an Uber or Lyft. 

BART 
Unfortunately, the park is not close enough to walk from a BART subway station. But if you’d like to take public transportation, get off at Rockridge BART and request an Uber or Lyft from the station to the Piedmont Community Hall. The journey will be about 2.5 miles. 

BUS 
You could take the BART to 19th Street Oakland BART station and transfer to the #11 AC Transit bus heading toward Piedmont for 15 minutes. Get off at the Highland and Mountain Avenue stop and that will drop you in front of the park. 

The wedding ceremony will take place at Exedra Plaza, which you can find by the big vase:

Sunday, November 1, 2015

This is the end of Daylight Saving Time, so that means your clock will go back one hour. Don’t forget to adjust your clock! 

Please be arrive to the park by 3:30 p.m. 

Due to end of Daylight Saving Time, we’ve had to adjust for the earlier sunset by scheduling the ceremony earlier. The ceremony will be followed by drinks, appetizers, dinner and dessert. 

This wedding will have indoor/outdoor locations and Bay Area weather is unpredictable, so bring a jacket.
