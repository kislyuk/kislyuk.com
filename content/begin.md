Summary: Using the Python 3.4 asyncio module for fun and profit

*This is the first in a series of blog posts about new features in Python 3.4 and my work on migrating from Python 2.7 to 3.4.*

Python 3.4 was [released on March 16](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.0/) and brings with it a host of interesting new features. The most important and impactful news is undoubtedly the addition of the new [asyncio](https://docs.python.org/3.4/library/asyncio.html) module, which brings standard library support for asynchronous I/O and coroutines.

This is exciting news to anyone using Python for high-performance servers or other multithreaded work.

*WIP. Next: deep dive*
